## Clock stop model

The main spreadsheet for capacity planning is complex. It is not that easy to understand immediately. It is also designed to be team specific. To deal with problems at higher level of abstraction and one at a time people involved in capacity / demand modelling have asked to estimate at first how many **"clock stops"** could one worker complete in a week's time.

> Clock stop definition
> * A meaningful assessment is done for the patient
> * A co-produced care plan is made
> 	- _OR_ a social intervention (e.g. "social prescribing") is started
> 	- _OR_ an evidence based intervention is started

Hence it is clear that a 15 minute triage or an incomplete assessment will not do.

Clock stop model counts the time needed to achieve that and estimates how many clock stops could one perform per week (then extrapolating to a year). It does so for 3 psychological pathways and 2 CORE teams (Community Mental Health Teams). Predictably - it takes nearly twice the time to produce a psychological assessment. 

Model is based on the more complex main spreadsheet, deleting too complex moving parts. It is _realistic_ in the sense that the weekly overhead (reflecting the way how teams work) and total time available to one WTE is counted here. It is a bit like the [Spherical Cow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow) too - in the sense that assumption is of a newly hired competent assessor that does not do any other work but assessments. (Something like 2018 when centralised assessment service was there  for the whole Trust). In reality everybody in teams has other clinical work too and can only do so many assessments per month. 

Another strong part of the model is that the time spent on **Clinical Intellectual Work** (CIW) - i.e. brilliant basics without which an assessment is meaningless - is identified. Similarly the time spent on data overhead (fields in RiO that need to be populated so that informatics can "track" the clock-stops) is identified too. In the world of the Spherical Cow the informatics could reliably track clock-stops from CIW, in practice this unfortunately cannot happen, therefore the data overhead is an important reality.
